    <h1> Do You Prefer Books or Movies </h1>
    <p> Some people prefer books and some prefer movies. But which is superior.
      Books are for people who like detail and want to paint a
      picture of what they think the character/place looks like. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Reading has been going down in popularity as movies have risen. People
      have to time for a job, friends, family. What person has the time to read
      a 500 or even a 1,000 page book these days. I'd rather watch a short video
      or a short summary (spark notes for people who don't want to read the
      whole book).</p>

    <br>
    <p> Even with movies becoming more popular, the acting quality in a more and
      more shows/movies have been going down in the past years. Also, there are
      still book nerds who like to collect books and read during any free time
      they get. Readers like that books are much more in depth while movies have
      to shorten to fit the whole story; they leave out some interesting parts
      to fit a time limit. </p>
    <br>
    <p> The reading experience is more of a independant act. When watching a
      movie you can go to the theater, you can invite friends, and order a
      variety of food. There is never a group of people reading a book in a
      group; unless it's a book club. But there are no friends getting together
      to read for fun. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Another reason movies are more popular is that you can watch a movie
      multiple times. Reading a book again is more difficult, it takes a long
      time(it may be fun if you have the time). On the other hand, movies are
      time bound, meaning there is a limited time to how long you can watch.
      Books can free the imagination, the writer let's the reader's create what
      they think the characters and places look like. Sometimes the movie
      changes completely from the book. You can do different things in movies
      than in books and vice versa. There are pros and cons on each side.</p>
    <br>
    <p> At the end of the day it is up to the individual. Some like to read and
      some like to watch movies. Either way they are both entertaining and a big
      part in everyone's lives. </p>
    <br>
    <footer> I personally like watching movies and tv shows. When I was younger
      I favored books like Percy Jackson, Hunger Games, and a few of the Harry
      Potter books. After a few years I became more and more picky on my reading
      until I honestly stopped all together. Movies are just less effort and I
      like to see the VFX. You can sit back and watch; with friends, family, or
      even with a date.</footer>
